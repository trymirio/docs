## Overview

Versive can send webhooks when interviews are completed.

Webhooks are emitted after interview enrichment, so each event includes transcript data and parsed conversation content.

## Event Types

Currently supported events:

- `interview.completed`

Notes:

- Screened-out interviews are not delivered as webhooks.
- Webhooks are configured at the organization level.

## Payload

Webhook request bodies use this shape:

```json
{
  "event_type": "interview.completed",
  "interview": {
    "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "title": "My Study/study_123/3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "status": "closed",
    "is_mock": false,
    "is_archived": false,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "started_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:12Z",
    "ended_at": "2024-01-01T00:09:41Z",
    "type": "VERSIVE",
    "metadata": {},
    "active_time": 569,
    "recording_url": "https://...",
    "transcript": "...",
    "parsed_conversation_json": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello, and thanks for joining."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Happy to help."
      }
    ],
    "vid": "vid_123"
  },
  "study": {
    "id": "study_123",
    "title": "My Study",
    "metadata": {},
    "type": "VERSIVE_STUDY",
    "mode": "TEXT_AND_VOICE",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `recording_url` can be `null` if no generated recording is available.
- `started_at` and `ended_at` are derived from the first and last interview messages when available.

## Delivery and Verification

Versive uses Svix for webhook delivery.

You should verify signatures on every request using Svix headers:

- `svix-id`
- `svix-timestamp`
- `svix-signature`

Use your Svix endpoint secret and the official Svix verification libraries.

## Reliability

- Events are sent with a stable event identity to support idempotent handling.
- Duplicate send attempts are deduplicated.
- If you need replay support for failed deliveries, contact the Versive team.
