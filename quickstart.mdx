- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (optional, for installing tools on macOS)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trymirio/versive.git
cd versive
```

### 2. Setup Versive DB (Supabase)

The `versive_db` directory contains the configuration and migrations for the Supabase database.

1. Navigate to the `versive_db` directory:
   ```bash
   cd versive_db
   ```

2. Start the local database:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up --local
   ```

### 3. Setup Versive API (Backend)

The `versive_api` project is a FastAPI backend service.

1. Navigate to the `versive_api` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../versive_api
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4. Setup Interviewer (Frontend)

The `interviewer` project is a Next.js application.

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `interviewer` directory:
   ```bash
   cd interviewer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/trymirio/versive/blob/main/versive/README.md) in the `versive` directory or check the `versive_db` section for database-specific troubleshooting.
