## Prerequisites

To use the Versive API, you need:

1.  A Versive account.
2.  An API Key. You can generate one in your [Organization Settings](https://getversive.com/dashboard).

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using a Bearer Token. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Making Your First Request

Here's how to list your studies using `curl`.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getversive.com/api/v1/studies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You should receive a JSON response with a list of your studies.

## Next Steps

- Explore the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) to see all available endpoints.
- Check out our [SDKs](/sdks/python) for easier integration.
- Read [Webhooks](/webhooks) to receive `interview.completed` events in your own systems.
